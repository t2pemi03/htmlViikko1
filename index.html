    <h3>Basic information about the band and why I like them</h3>
    <p>HIM was a goth rock band from Finland from 1991 to 2017. </p>
    <p>The band had many lineups trough out the years but the most well known one contains Ville Valo as the lead singer, Gas Lipstick on the drums, Mikko "Mige" Paananen on the bass guitar, Janne "Burton" puurtinen as the keyboard player and Mikko "Linde" Lindstr√∂m as the guitarist.  </p> 
    <p>The reason why I really like the band is that they offer their own style and take to the rock/metal genre while taking inspiration from great bands like Black Sabbath. This style of metal even got it's own genre name called Love Metal. Also a big factor for me has been the lead singers very charismatic and signature singing style.  </p>
